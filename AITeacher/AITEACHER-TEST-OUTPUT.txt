Welcome to the AITeacher program! This program will help an elementary school student
learn simple multiplication. Two random single digit numbers will be generated and the
student will be asked to solve a multiplication problem of the two numbers. If they
get the problem incorrect, they will be prompted to try again until the provide the
correct answer. Once the correct answer is given, the student will be asked if they would
like to solve another problem. So long as they answer Y for yes they will continue to
be given new problems. If they answer N for no, the program will quit.
